/*
    ### KEY TERMS
    -- vertex: A node in a graph.
    -- edge: A connection between two vertices.
    -- adjacent: When an edge exists between vertices.
    -- path: A sequence of one or more edges between vertices.
    -- disconnected: Graph where at least two vertices have no path connecting them.
    -- weighted: Graph where edges have an associated cost.
    -- directed: Graph where travel between vertices can be restricted to a single direction.
    -- cycle: A path which begins and ends at the same vertex (opposite is acyclic).
    -- adjacency matrix: Graph representation where vertices are both the rows and the columns. Each cell represents a possible edge.
    -- adjacency list: Graph representation where each vertex has a list of all the vertices it shares an edge with.

    ### METHODS FOR TRAVERSING A GRAPH
    -- depth-first search (DFS)
        helpful for detecting if a path exists between two vertices
        can use a stack or recursion to keep track of vertices
    -- breath-first search (BFS)
        helpful for finding the shortest path between two vertices
        uses a queue to keep track of vertices
    -- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm 
        used for finding the shortest distance from a given point to every other point in a weighted graph

    ### RUNTIME
        O(vertices + edges);
